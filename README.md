## Note to self about how to use Git

### Whenever you start work

This makes sure any changes that occurred while you were away are loaded onto your computer

```{bash}
git fetch
git pull
```

### Makes Git aware of changes you've made since last commit

```{bash}
git add .
```

### 'Commits' the changes - i.e. gives them a name

```{bash}
git commit -m "description of changes here"
```

### 'Pushes' the changes to GitHub

```{bash}
git push
```
